# Flower Classification 🌹🌺🪴

## Project Overview 📊
This Jupyter Notebook delves into a synthetic dataset encompassing roses, shoeblack plants, and hibiscus. The dataset mirrors real-world flower attributes such as species, size, fragrance, and height. Our primary goal is to unearth hidden patterns, trends, and correlations within this floral universe through:

> **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncovering data characteristics and quality.<br>
> **Data Visualization**: Creating compelling visual representations of insights.<br>
> **Statistical Analysis**: Applying statistical methods to understand relationships.<br>
> **Machine Learning Modeling**: Building predictive models for flower classification (Support Vector Classifier, Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors).<br>

## Dataset Description 📁
The dataset comprises simulated flower data, providing a robust foundation for analysis and modeling.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Clone the repository: 
Use the following command to clone the repo 🔽<br>
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flower-power.git

**Set up environment**: Ensure you have Python and necessary libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn) installed.<br>
**Run the notebook**: Open the Jupyter Notebook in the notebooks folder and execute the code cells.<br>

## Results and Findings 🔍

The notebook presents a comprehensive analysis, including:

Data cleaning and preprocessing steps.<br>
Exploratory data visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, box plots, pie charts, kde plots).<br>
Statistical summaries and correlation heatmap.<br>
Model performance evaluation (accuracy, precision).<br>

## Future Work 🌱

> Incorporate additional flower species and attributes.<br>
> Explore more complex machine learning algorithms.<br>
> Build a web application for interactive visualization and prediction.<br>
